- create a function that gets the books from the firestore database, more info [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data)
- create a function that takes the book and delete it from the database, more info [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/delete-data#delete_documents)

#### Bonus

- use the firebase sign-in to sign a user and then make the books added in the firestore database to that user depending on their tokens, more info on the firebase auth [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui)
